The dataset in this study is designed to represent a comprehensive range of EEG-derived time series features relevant to the assessment of anesthesia depth. It contains 1500 instances, each simulating an observation during a surgical or clinical scenario. The features include signal entropy, Hjorth parameters (activity, mobility, and complexity), signal energy, power spectral densities across common EEG frequency bands (theta, alpha, beta, gamma), and the bispectral index, which is a commonly used empirical measure for assessing consciousness. These variables are modeled based on typical physiological ranges observed in EEG signals under different levels of sedation, thereby reflecting meaningful variability as would be expected in clinical data.

Each instance is labeled with a class that indicates the depth level of anesthesia, categorized into three levels: deep (0), moderate (1), and light (2). The class label is computed through a rule-based function that evaluates the bispectral index, entropy, and complexity values to approximate how clinicians assess sedation depth based on signal behavior. This classification strategy introduces a controlled mapping from multivariate signal characteristics to discrete clinical states, ensuring internal consistency of the dataset. The final dataset is normalized to facilitate its direct use in machine learning workflows and is stored as a CSV file, with the class column positioned as the last attribute for compatibility with supervised learning pipelines.
